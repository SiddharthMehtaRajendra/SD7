**Designing Typeahead Suggestion**

**What to be designed?**

1. Real-time suggestion service, which recommends search terms based on what is being typed should be designed
2. Typeahead suggestions enable users to search for common and most-frequently searched terms. 
3. As the user enters the search query, this service tries to predict the query based on characters entered and displays a list of best-matching suggestions. 
4. This service helps users to better articulate what they are looking for and lends a helping hand in constructing the right search query. Relevance of query is important than the speed of displaying the results 

**Feature Requirements**

Primary Features:

1. As the query is being typed by the user, the top 10 terms starting with whatever the user has typed should be suggested by the service.

Secondary Requirements:

1. Suggestions should be displayed in real-time as the user types.
2. User should be able to see the suggestion results within 200ms. 

**TO DO : Follow the below framweork to design System. Mandatory upload of hand drawn photos of design.**

**Capacity Estimation and Constraints**

What will your estimations of scale? As a system design student you should be able to make intelligent assumptions based on real life systems.
